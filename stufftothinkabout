double precision
long double!
double min max
double flags (field width etc)
figure out zeros in doubles (neg zero and pos zero)

master ft_atoi_base and ft_itoa_base

test long max with ld etc to see if
we shouldn't cast directly to ll

basic tests : 16


weird invalid format:

if is a valid flag that is alpha, printfield and not flag
if known flag but negative, don't do anything

if not known alpha format or flag (eg Z, R, k, m..)
print field based off of left or right adjustment


looks at all chars after %. if the char is not a valid format or flag,
skip fmt to that point. if there is a field_length, print it (with zero
padding)

either char found is valid, print it if '-' not present

while char is either a digit or valid non alpha flag (eg - + * #)
